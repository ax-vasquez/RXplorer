# RXplorer
A sample app used to demonstrate various RxJava implementations.

## Quick Start
RXplorer is set up to run out-of-the-box; simply download the project, open in Android Studio, then compile and run! Full disclosure, I have only been able to test this on a Galaxy S8, though there should not be anything "fancy" here that would break on other devices. With that said, I am of limited omnipotence, so if you see something not working quite right, please let me know! Feedback is very much appreciated!

## Features
- [LoggerBot](https://github.com/ax-vasquez/RXplorer/tree/master/loggerbot)
    - Reactive in-app logging solution
